# Let’s practice using Puppet to make changes to our configuration file.
# Just as in the previous configuration file task,
# we’d like you to set up your client
# SSH configuration file so that
# you can connect to a server without typing a password.
# Requirements:
# Your SSH client configuration 
# must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
# Your SSH client configuration 
# must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
